# Android-Malware-Analysis
In this I have used one dataset fron kaggle to perform static analysis on application's required permissions to check weather the application is benign or malicious using different machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Baiye, K neighbour Classifier and Decisions Tree Classifier.
For this dataset the Decision Tree Classifier has the best accuracy i.e. more than 93%.
